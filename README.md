PROJECT INFO / DOCUMENTATION:
-- Original project readme can be found under the 'Documentation Group 13' folder
-- User stories document which includes tasks, and members assigned to each task is in the 'Documentation Group 13' folder
-- Design.md can be found within the 'Documentation Group 13' folder as well

TEST COVERAGE, AND IMPLEMENTATION:
-- Original coverage for UI changes made regarding icons etc is included in pull request reviews, as the UI changes would be viewed before the pull request is approved.
This was done due to the fact it is very difficult to observe changes made to Uasset files within github itself.

NOTICE REGARDING UI_CUSTOMIZATION BRANCH:
-- Changes, and commits made to the UI_Customization branch were unable to be pulled to master. A pull request for the branch was made, and approved but due to a large number of 
file conflicts caused by unknown reasons appearing partway through the pull request, it subsequently was unable to be completed. Ultimately we would please request that this branch 
is viewed individually however briefly to view commits etc made to it. The branch will be left as is, as there is very little time left during the project, and our team direly needs 
code based commits, and we do not have the time to fully resolve these conflicts with the UI_Customization branch. 

NOTICE REGARDING PROJECT DIRECTION CHANGE:
-- Up until the date of 4/14/2021 most of our project primarily regarded UI changes being made via Uasset files. After some email correspondance, we realized there had been a few 
miscommunication problems on our end, and we had poured far too much time working in the unreal editor on these files. The last two weeks of project work were all related to churning
out as many C++ code based features as was possible for the project, and we apologize for the misunderstanding.

NOTICE REGARDING USER STORIES, AND TASKS:
-- User stories, and tasks can be seen in the user stories document within the group 13 documentation folder, in addition to this, a link to our Jira board we have been using is included at this link: https://ceg-4110-project.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&projectKey=C4P&view=planning&selectedIssue=C4P-59&issueLimit=100

NOTICE REGARDING ACTUALLY RUNNING OPEN TOURNAMENT:
-- The way the original owners of the Open Tournament repo intended to run the project is to locally clone the repo, and run things via generating a .sln file from the 'OpenTournament.uproject' file in the first level of the repo. This will require unreal engine 4.25, and further details can be seen within the original README file from the original devs within our group 13 documentation folder in the README.md file there.
