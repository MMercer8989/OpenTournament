## User Stories
| Story No. | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| C4P-12 | As a player of open tournament, I would like increased interactivity / upgraded icons for user HUD so I can have an overall better, more complete experience with the game. |
| C4P-8 | As an individual who works with, and upgrades the visuals of open tournament I would like to create a customization menu for HUD, and Weapon skins so I can have an easy to use layout to eventually customize my experience. |
| C4P-44 | As a player of open tournament I want indication of players on killing sprees, and being shut down from killing sprees so the game can have a more rewarding/incentivizing interactions with kill streaks. |
| C4P-47 | As a player of open tournament I would like different messages to be displayed upon kill for different weapons so I can enjoy a humorous interactive experience closer to other arena shooters. |
| C4P-45 | As a developer of open tournament I would like the ability to test the functionality of the jump pads automatically, so I can ensure their functionality works properly in an efficient manner. |
| C4P-46 | As a developer of open tournament I want more meaningful developer status messages displayed beyond a proof of concept design so that I can have more informative feedback while I am testing open tournament. |
| C4P-48 | As a developer of open tournament I would like varying knockback values for weapons to be customized for each weapon so I can create a more unique feel for each weapon. |
| C4P-64 | As a developer of OpenTournament, I would like to see the game's armor pickup, and removal behavior be improved so player interactions with armor are handled properly. |
